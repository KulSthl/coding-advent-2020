Trying to use every programming language


|  Day 	| Programming Language  	|    | My opinion |
|---	|---	| ------   |----|
| 1  	| Julia  	| ✔ | I like |
| 2  	| Rust  	| ✔ | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but docu is great, overall good |
| 3  	| C#  	| ✔  | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but it was a great experience |
| 4  	| Ruby  	| ✔  | Kind of okish no overhead but tooling was not simple to install and it was just something off |
| 5  	| Perl  	|  ✔  | Didnt like it at all tooling was easy to install but everything was just strange. Documentation was also not easy to find, I just think its too old   |
| 6  	| Python  	| ✔  | Same as Julia, but better tooling and more documentation |
