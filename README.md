Trying to use every programming language


|  Day 	| Programming Language  	|    | My opinion |
|---	|---	| ------   |----|
| 1  	| Julia  	| ✔ | I like |
| 2  	| Rust  	| ✔ | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but docu is great, overall good |
| 3  	| C#  	| ✔  | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but it was a great experience |
| 4  	| Ruby  	| ✔  | Kind of okish no overhead but tooling was not simple to install and it was just something off |
| 5  	| Perl  	|  ✔  | Didnt like it at all tooling was easy to install but everything was just strange. Documentation was also not easy to find, I just think its too old   |
| 6  	| Python  	| ✔  | Same as Julia, but better tooling and more documentation |
| 7  	| Kotlin  	| ✔ | I dont like Java that much and its maybe better but still having to use gradle or maven is never good in my book |
| 8  	| Java  	|  ✔  | This was my first language but gradle and maven is just a over complicated mess and the language is too verbose and redundant |
| 9  	| C 	| ✔  | It was a experience, I did not know how to get utility functions and searching was hard because of c++ it was not a good experience and I did not knew what Im doing. I think the learning curve is really steep and now with Rust I dont see myself ever to attempt it |
| 10  	| C++ 	| ✔  | It was definitely better than C in a newbie perspective, but still not feeling confident in this language |
| 11  	| OCaml  	|  ❌  | I cant do it. Its so confusing for me. I find the docu not good at all. I never saw something remotely comparable. So I made it in Rust |
| 12  	| Typescript  	| ✔  | Its my most used language (or framework for a language) and I like it. I just know how to do everything but still the setup process for this kind of stuff is suboptimal. You will need boilerplate as manual setup is just too complicated |
| 13  	| Dart  	| ✔  | It was good, after downloading the sdk everything worked out of the box in vscode. Most of the stuff worked as expected, but some features are sadly missing like to iterate with forEach with the index and the object |
| 14  	| PHP  	|  ✔  | I remeber why I hate it |
| 15  	|  Go 	| [ ]  | |
| 16  	|  Scala 	| [ ]  | |
| 17  	| Javascript  	| [ ]  | |
| 18  	|  R 	| [ ]  | |
| 19  	|  Swift 	| [ ]  | |
| 20  	|   Nim	| [ ]  | |
| 21  	|  Zig 	| [ ]  | |
| 22  	|   D	| [ ]  | |
| 23  	|   F#	| [ ]  | |
| 24  	|   Haskell	| [ ]  | |
