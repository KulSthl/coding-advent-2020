Trying to use every programming language


|  Day 	| Programming Language  	|    | My opinion |
|---	|---	| ------   |----|
| 1  	| Julia  	| ✔ | I like |
| 2  	| Rust  	| ✔ | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but docu is great, overall good |
| 3  	| C#  	| ✔  | Too much overhead for this kind of simple stuff but it was a great experience |
| 4  	| Ruby  	| ✔  | Kind of okish no overhead but tooling was not simple to install and it was just something off |
| 5  	| Perl  	|  ✔  | Didnt like it at all tooling was easy to install but everything was just strange. Documentation was also not easy to find, I just think its too old   |
| 6  	| Python  	| ✔  | Same as Julia, but better tooling and more documentation |
| 7  	| Kotlin  	| ✔ | I dont like Java that much and its maybe better but still having to use gradle or maven is never good in my book |
| 8  	| Java  	|  ✔  | This was my first language but gradle and maven is just a over complicated mess and the language is too verbose and redundant |
| 9  	| C 	| ✔  | It was a experience, I did not know how to get utility functions and searching was hard because of c++ it was not a good experience and I did not knew what Im doing. I think the learning curve is really steep and now with Rust I dont see myself ever to attempt it |
